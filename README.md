# Deploying WordPress to a VPS Using Virtualmin

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy your WordPress site to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) using **Virtualmin**, a powerful and user-friendly graphical control panel. Virtualmin simplifies server management, making it easier to handle multiple websites in the future.

## Prerequisites

- **VPS Server:** Ensure you have access to a VPS with root privileges. Popular VPS providers include [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/).

   ```
   - Replace `yourusername` with your desired username.
   - Switch to the new user:
